Exercises for Ruby on Rails. In this repository I will cover an array of various exercises using an assortment of
Techniques I have learned in my classes at the Davinci Institute, under the direction of Jason Noble.

Expected Output for number_of_seconds.rb file when run from the command line is:

There are 60 seconds in a minute.
There are 60 minutes in an hour.
There are 24 hours in a day.
There are 7 days in a week.
That means there are:
3600 seconds in an hour,
86400 seconds in an day,
and 604800 seconds in a week.
That means when you turn 20, you've been alive for 628992000 seconds,
and if you make it to 100, you will have lived 3144960000 seconds. Make them count!

NOTE: Use descriptive variable names, and calculate the values.

Expected output for lrthw_ex1.rb file when run from the command line is:

Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.

NOTE: This exercise can be found at http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html

Expected output for lrthw_ex1.rb file after doing the extras listed below:

Make the script print another line.
Make the script print only one line.
Add a final line to the script explaining what an octothorpe is and what id does in Ruby.

OUTPUT:
This line is extra, and was not here before.
An octothorpe is also called a "hash", and in Ruby code it will comment out the line that follows it.
