Exercises for Ruby on Rails. In this repository I will cover an array of various exercises using an assortment of
Techniques I have learned in my classes at the Davinci Institute, under the direction of Jason Noble.

Expected Output for number_of_seconds.rb file when run from the command line is:

  There are 60 seconds in a minute.
  There are 60 minutes in an hour.
  There are 24 hours in a day.
  There are 7 days in a week.
  That means there are:
  3600 seconds in an hour,
  86400 seconds in an day,
  and 604800 seconds in a week.
  That means when you turn 20, you've been alive for 628992000 seconds,
  and if you make it to 100, you will have lived 3144960000 seconds. Make them count!

NOTE: Use descriptive variable names, and calculate the values.

Expected output for lrthw_ex1.rb file when run from the command line is:

  Hello World!
  Hello Again
  I like typing this.
  This is fun.
  Yay! Printing.
  I'd much rather you 'not'.
  I "said" do not touch this.

NOTE: This exercise can be found at http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html

Expected output for lrthw_ex1.rb file after doing the extras listed below:

  Make the script print another line.
  Make the script print only one line.
  Add a final line to the script explaining what an octothorpe is and what it does in Ruby.

  OUTPUT:
  This line is extra, and was not here before.
  An octothorpe is also called a "hash", and in Ruby code it will comment out the line that follows it.

Expected output for lrthw_ex2.rb file when run from the command line is:

  I could have code lke this.
  This will run.

Expected output for lrthw_ex3.rb file when run from the command line is:

  I will now count my chickens:
  Hens 30.0
  Roosters 97.0
  Now I will count the eggs:
  7.0
  Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?
  false
  What is 3 + 2? 5.0
  What is 5 - 7? -2.0
  Oh, that's why it's false.
  How about some more.
  Is it greater? true
  Is it greater or equal? true
  Is it less or equal? false

NOTE: Notice the octothorpes and how they are used to document whats happening in the code without affecting
the functionality. Also the method ".to_f" can be used to change whole numbers to floating point numbers.

Expected output for lrthw_ex4.rb file when run from the command line is:
